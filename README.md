CoreCSS
=======

CoreCSS is a minimal front-end web framework, built entirely in CSS with love by Patrick Griffiths, there is no CSS pre-processing and the source is well commented.  This framework was developed as a lightweight alternative to the larger frameworks out there, with the intent for 'you' the user to be able to be free to rapidly develop full websites and mockups with the ability to swap in and out any JS frameworks and or libraries that you see fit or just build on top of the CSS as you see fit.

#### Prerequisites
All you need to be able to use this framework is a simple understanding of HTML & CSS. Once you know the basics and have an IDE then you'll be good to go with using the Core-Framework.


I would recommend using Adobe Brackets. (http://brackets.io)

#### How To Use:
I've split the grid from the main CSS file so that you can use any grd system that you like if you don't quite like the one I've developped here.

######To include the grid:
```html
<link href="css/core-grid.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```
######To include the Core css file:
```html
<link href="css/core.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

####Getting Started

This information is being worked on and will be uploaded to Github with enough documentation to get someone started with using the framework, and then more information will be hosted on the main CoreCSS webpage once I get around to creating it with 'this' framework...

For the time being this repo is mostly to backup and protect the framework from any kind of accidental deletion. Once ready this ReadMe will most definitely be update with links and information on how to use!

Thank you for your patience and feel free to contact me at any time... COntact info is commented into the CSS files.

####Browser Support:

I need to review a few things before disclosing this information (:)) However it is safe to assume that Firefox and Chrome will be 100% supported...

---

####Licensing:

MIT

####Contributions
Feel free to contact me regarding any contributions, if you feel you know how to do something more efficiently than I have, then please do get in touch, I know there is already room for improvement and I will be working on those changes as I go.  All fork/pull requests are welcome :)

---

####TO-DO:
- Full-Proof the Typography. (across all devices, resolutions & platforms)
- Fine Tune Grid Systems Responsiveness on mobile devices from desktop resolutions.
- Create a minimal responsive JS system for the navigation elements. (in Native JS)
- Create better documentation.
- Clean up CSS format.
- Develop more examples.
- Further optimise where possible.
- More to come...

Future Desired Implementations include: A
14 col grid and a 16 col grid option.

####Note:
There will now be a very minimal amount of JavaScript used within CoreCSS, it's solely for the responsive menues and navigational elements, and will be developped with 100% native JS, so no requirement to depend on Jquery and or any other library/framework, so the original intent and goal behind the ramework is still intact. You will be able to strip this out if you wish to use Jquery or any other framework for your sites JS related features.
