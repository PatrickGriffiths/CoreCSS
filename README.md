CoreCSS
=======

CoreCSS is a minimal front-end web framework, built entirely in CSS with love by Patrick Griffiths, there is no CSS pre-processing and the source is well commented.  This framework was developed as a lightweight alternative to the larger frameworks out there, with the intent for 'you' the user to be able to be free to rapidly develop full websites and mockups with the ability to swap in and out any JS frameworks and or libraries that you see fit as well as build off of the CSS as you see fit.

###Version:
v0.4.2 - Stable & functioning state.

---

####Features:
- Grid System. (responsive)
- Custom minimal icons.
- Mockup styles for base elements.
- Helper classes.
- lightweight background images for mockups.
- Well commented code
- Easy to edit and extend
- Example files (templates; Being worked on)
- Extensive documentation (Currently being developed)

I'm not sure this next one is a feature, but this framework has a passionate and devoted developer who is always learnig new things and always looking for ways to improve his works.

#### Prerequisites
All you need to be able to use this framework is a simple understanding of HTML & CSS. Once you know the basics and have an IDE then you'll be good to go with using the Core-Framework.


I would recommend using Adobe Brackets. (http://brackets.io)

#### How To Use:
I've split the grid from the main CSS file so that you can use any grd system that you like if you don't quite like the one I've developped here. 

######To include the grid: 
```html 
<link href="css/core-grid.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```
######To include the Core css file: 
```html 
<link href="css/core.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```
